The task:
Using Java or JavaScript and Angular JS (Angular 2 if you've used it), write a simple program to find the solution to the triangle
peg game (see http://www.joenord.com/puzzles/peggame/ for the game rules and one solution). Itâ€™s less important what solution it
finds, as long as the program is written simply, generically, and works recursively to find any solution that leaves one pin in
the game. You can then just display the list of moves in the solution.
It is up to you how to demonstrate solution. Please think creatively.
For Java mode - Data Driven Testing is required (http://jazzteam.org/ru/technical-articles/data-driven-testing/).

Solution:
This program using recursive algorithm DFS ( depth search ) for finding a solution Triangle Page Game. First program initializes
playing field ( boolean matrix 5x5 ).  After program sets out blank position peg in matrix 5x5. The DFS function is called
( function used method possibleFieldList from the class SearchPossibleField, in this method are generate list of all possible
moves from that position). Reviewing this list call recursive search method ( the search method algorithm is equivalent to
the DFS method but includes a check for the presence of solution and returns a boolean value ( true if solution found ).
